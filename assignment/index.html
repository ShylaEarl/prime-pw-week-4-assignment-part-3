    <ul>
      <li>Q1 When calling the function listItems and using the global variable basket as the argument,<br>
        the console (currently line 31) is logging undefined and I don't understand why.<br>
        Could you explain why that is? Thanks!</li>
      <li>Q2 What is the term for what we are asked to do in part 3 of the stretch goals?<br>
        Nested functions, helper functions, etc.? I was trying to research this concept (using a function in a conditional)<br>
        but wasn't very sucessful in finding out how to do this. I am SO curious now!
